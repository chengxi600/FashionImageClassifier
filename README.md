# FashionImageClassifier
Built a CNN model that classifies fashion images into 8 article types based on the dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/paramaggarwal/fashion-product-images-small. The written report detailing this project can be found in the 'paper' folder, or click [here](/paper/CS4100_Report.pdf).
